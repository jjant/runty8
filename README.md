# Runty8

A Pico8 clone in rust

## Things to do

- [ ] Unify data structures (sprite sheet/map/etc) under a single Memory byte array?
      Not sure this is good (tho it may simplify having the map and sprite sheet overlapping in memory, otherwise that has to be programmer manually).
- [x] Support Ctrl+r/Cmd+r to restart game
- [ ] Modify editor W, A, S, D key short cuts (shift sprite) to use arrow keys
- [ ] Implement sprite editor tools: line, circle, selection tool, zoom, etc
- [ ] Editor currently gets its assets (ui icons, etc) like a regular pico8 game, which means it renders the wrong UI when running a proper game
- [ ] Finish porting the pico8 API (missing functions like `peek`, `poke`, `circ`, etc)
- [ ] Sound effects (both playing sounds in games, and the whole sound editor thing)
- [ ] Building/packaging your game as a single file.
      Currently the library stores your assets (sprite sheet, map, sprite flags (and sound in the future))
      in separate files, and the application loads them at runtime.
      It'd be cool to have a way to bundle all the code and assets together in a single executable file for ease of distribution.
      This should also facilitate using wasm.
- [ ] Wasm support
- [ ] Add a concept of "active widget" in the sprite editor
      If you're click-dragging the mouse in the color picker, moving the mouse away will trigger interactions in other components, this is wrong
- [ ] Find a way to name the multiple overloads on functions (in Lua, `spr` can be called with `3-7` attributes)
- [ ] Some rudimentary console-like thing like in Pico8 (to run graphic commands, etc)
